<h2>Position numbers in two-, three- and n-dimensions</h2>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>
Angle-dependent rotation factors have been introduced to rotate vectors. Position numbers constructed from rotation factors have been proposed and shown to be multiplication commutative in two and higher dimensions. Based on rotation factors, complex numbers and Eulerâ€™s formula have been developed in a novel way. In two-dimensions, the position numbers and complex numbers are exhibited to be equivalent. But in three and higher n-dimensions, there are no equivalent hypercomplex numbers for the position numbers.
